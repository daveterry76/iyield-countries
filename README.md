## Task

Create a reusable React component that allows the user to search for and select a country.
The user should be able to search by the country name or by the
[two-letter country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). The search
should behave as follows:
- If the user enters their search term in lower case it should perform a case-insensitive
  search.
- If the search term includes a capital letter it should be a case-sensitive search.

For example:
- If the user enters "sw" the search should return:
  - Botswana
  - Eswatini
  - Sweden
  - Switzerland
- If the user enters "Sw" the search should return:
  - Sweden
  - Switzerland
- If the user enters "SE" the search should return:
  - Sweden (since this country's 2-letter code is "SE")

If you are familiar with GraphQL you should use this API:
- https://countries.trevorblades.com/
- https://github.com/trevorblades/countries

If you prefer REST you can use:
- https://restcountries.com/v3.1/independent
- https://restcountries.com/

This repo should be used as a starting point but you can make any changes you like to the
structure and included configuration files. You can use any 3rd party libraries you think
are appropriate. The repo is already configured to use
[MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) and you are encouraged to build your
component using MUI components. The appearance of the component is left up to you.

The code you write should be production quality and therefore have an appropriate level
of type safety, tests and documentation about how to use your component.

- node v18 or later
